# POPVOTE
A reactive and verified voting system for Australia that is easily adaptable to other countries.
## What
Popvote aims to keep political leaders honest by removing any ambiguity about what their constituents want them to do.
A primary goal of Popvote is to rank all political leaders (council, state, and federal) based on how they perform, thus providing the citizenry with a robust and transparent ranking and performance history when it comes to election time.
All Popvote users must be registered on the Australian Electoral Roll to prevent fabricated votes.
## Building and running
Popvote is written in [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install "Meteor Install Guide").

Once you have Meteor up and running, simply clone this repository and type:
```
meteor run
```
