# POPVOTE
A reactive and verified voting system for Australia that is easily adaptable to other countries.
## What
Popvote aims to keep political leaders in check by removing any ambiguity about what their constituents want. A primary goal of Popvote is to rank all political leaders (council, state, and federal) based on how they perform, providing the citizenry with a robust and transparent ranking and performance history when it comes to election time.
